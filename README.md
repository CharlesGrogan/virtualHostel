<h1>Virtual Hostel</h1>

<h2>Concept</h2>
We saw the need for Virtual Hostel to fill in gaps that websites like Trip Advisor and Yelp leave.  While reading reviews about individual businesses are useful, we were more interested in allowing the user to leave complete trip details, so you have a better picture of their vacation, why they went to the places they did, and how a destination stacks up as a true travel destination.

<h2>Technologies</h2>
We used a variety of technologies to make Virtual Hostel exist, but at it's core it is built using React.  Everything you see on the page is a component made in React.  Styling at it's core is <a href="https://bulma.io/">Bulma</a>, with some additional vanilla CSS styling thrown in.  Account and authorization are all handled via Passport.js.

<h2>Challenges</h2>
Our primary challenges with this were learning to work with state and lifecycle in React.  Being relatively new to React as a whole, the undertaking of this project with only a week to complete a full-stack application was our biggest challenge.

<h2>Future Iterations</h2>
For future iterations we would like to offer:
<ul>
  <li>better handling of user authentication.  Currently establishing an account only allows for creating a username and password.  We would like to add email registration (aloing with confirmation emails) and the ability for the user to establish a true user profile, which would then be used to viewing another users submitted content and even allowing users to interact with each other.  A comments section for trips allowing users to communicate via comments would also be useful.</li>

<li>a craigslist type section allowing for invdividuals to advertise services such as being a personal tourguide, sharing accomodations in other cities, looking for travel partners, etc.</li>
